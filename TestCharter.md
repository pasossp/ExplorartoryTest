## Summary :

 **Kebab Menu** : Functionality wise, this module is of high priority. Any bugs here directly affects the homepage as well. This page also contains the accounts and settings option which are crucial to the app. However, this feature seems to have  defect clustering as it has the most number of defects found so far. 
 
 **Home page**:
 Functionality wise, this module is of high priority. Any bugs here directly affects the whole purpose of the app. Validated the functionality of all the icons; works as expected except for one bug with edit expense.
 
 **Strawberry menu** : This is low priority on testing as it doesn't directly impact expense or balance in home page. The options worked as expected. All test cases passed. No bugs were observed.
